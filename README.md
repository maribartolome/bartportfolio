# Bong's Operations, Optimizations, and Creativity Portfolio ðŸ’¡

Hi! I'm Bong (Maricar), a passionate operations and process person who thrives in chaos and finds patterns others miss.
I've led teams, optimized billing systems, managed US clients, and even designed a vocabulary game for kids based on my daughter's love of words.

This GitHub is my playgroundâ€”where I share documentation, automations, systems I've built, and a few personal learning projects along the way.

ðŸ§  I'm passionate about:
- Process improvement & optimization
- Mental health & emotional awareness (especially in kids)
- Creating tools to make work/life easier
- Books, movies, and Marvel/DC
- Learning everything from bookkeeping to freediving
