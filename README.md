# Bong's Portfolio: Process, People, and Possibility 💡

Hi! I'm Bong (Maricar), a systems thinker and creative problem solver with a background in operations, client service, and remote team management. I’ve worked with U.S.-based companies and one Australian startup, where I helped build and optimize processes that reduced backlog, increased clarity, and made teams breathe a little easier.

I'm deeply drawn to order, but not the boring kind — the kind that makes chaos work for you. I build SOPs, automate repetitive tasks, and design systems that let people focus on the work that matters. Whether it's fixing insurance billing workflows, creating trackers, or guiding a VA team through onboarding, I bring structure with a human touch.

### 🔍 What you'll find here:
- **Operational SOPs** I've written or improved (AR workflows, hiring processes, onboarding)
- **Internal tools & templates** I use to manage people, monitor metrics, and keep teams aligned
- **The "Bong Maneuver"** — a method I created to manage overwhelming backlogs at Canva
- **Automation experiments** using Google Sheets and scripting to simplify admin work
- **Learning notes** from things I’m exploring — like bookkeeping, art therapy, and game design (not done yet, but on the horizon)

### 🧠 Interests and Values
- I’m a freediver and I love both Marvel and DC (yes, both).
- I’m fascinated by how people think and feel — especially kids. That curiosity led me to explore emotional literacy, neurodivergence, and how we build systems that don’t just work... but feel right.
- I believe in clarity, context, and giving people tools that actually support them.

This GitHub is a growing archive of what I’ve built, what I’m building, and what I’m learning as I go.
